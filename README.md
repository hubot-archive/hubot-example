[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hubot-scripts/hubot-example.png)](https://travis-ci.org/hubot-scripts/hubot-example)

## Directory Structure

Using the common directory structure for hubot script packages it will be easy
to manage and allow others to easily contribute to your package.

### script

This directory is home to a couple of development scripts; `bootstrap` and `test`
they're used to bootstrap the development environment and run tests
respectively.

### src

This directory is home to the actual hubot scripts in the package. Your
`index.coffee` entry point will load the scripts from this directory.

### test

This directory is home to any tests you write for your scripts. This example
package uses Mocha, Chai and Sinon to manage writing tests.

## Advantages of Building a Package

Some of the advantages of building an npm package for your hubot script(s) are:

* You don't need to rely on when hubot-scripts package is released.
* You can specify dependencies in the `package.json` rather than have users
  manually specify them
* You can easily add tests using your favourite frameworks and libraries

## Using with Hubot

Add dependency to `package.json`:
```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "hubot-example": "git://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-example.git#master"
  }
}
```

Include package in `external-scripts.json`:
```json
["hubot-example"]
```
